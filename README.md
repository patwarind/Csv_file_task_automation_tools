# CSV_file_task_automation_tools
Tools used for csv file task automation

I am designing tools to speed up some tasks involving .csv file format. 


A] Tool_1: ApplyFormulasToGroupOfFiles_SameName_v0.1

1. Information:
- If you want to manually extract data from multiple .csv files with the same name, it will take a lot of time.
- "ApplyFormulasToGroupOfFiles_SameName_v0.1" is a utility I developed to address this issue.
- The current version of this tool is 0.1.
- .csv is the accepted input file type.
- The generated output file is an.xlsx.

2. How to use this tool?:
- Simply download the.exe file from the repository (you will receive an unsafe warning from Explorer; choose to keep downloading).
- After downloading the.exe file, follow the "EXECUTION ACTION" section's instructions.

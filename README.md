Tools used for excel task automation

I am creatting tools to speed up some tasks involving .csv and .xlsx file format. 


1) Tool_1: ApplyFormulasToGroupOfFiles_v0.1
A) Information:
- If you have many files with same name and you want to extract some data from these files, then doing it manually will consume a lot of time.
- To solve this problem I have created "ApplyFormulasToGroupOfFiles_v0.1" tool.
- This is vession 0.1 of this tool.
- Input file format is .csv.
- Output file genarated is .xlsx.

B) How to use this tool?:
